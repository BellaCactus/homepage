# Bella

hi, i'm bella.

this github is a collection of personal projects, tools, and experiments.
most of this work is practical, scrappy, and built to solve real problems i ran into.

## projects
- network / overlay tools
- small utilities
- game-related tooling
- experiments that may or may not ever be finished

## status
this page is a placeholder.
a proper site will replace this later.

:)
